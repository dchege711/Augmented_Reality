* If AR devices are to be abundant in the future, fog computing will help alleviate the costs to running them.
* In this report, we'll aim to quantify the trade-off between data transfer & computational workload of different configurations.
* Below are hyperlinks to the findings:

        * We ran a holographic app in my laptop, and connected to a HoloLens via Wi-Fi.
        * We then measured the rate of data transfer over the Wi-Fi network and graphed the results.
