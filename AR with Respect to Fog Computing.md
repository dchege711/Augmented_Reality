* If AR devices are to be abundant in the future, fog computing will help alleviate the costs to running them.
* In this report, we'll aim to quantify the data transfer  of different configurations.

## The HoloLens without Fog Computation
* We'll start with the simplified case of one computer (our 'cloud') and one HoloLens as illustrated below:
![AR without Fog](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/blob/master/Unity_Tutorials/Screenshots/AR%20Without%20Fog.png)
* For starters, we'll try running the [Origami App](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/tree/master/Unity_Tutorials/Origami) with the code being hosted on the laptop.

### Possible Research Questions
* Quantify the computational workload in these configurations.
