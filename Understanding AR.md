# Understanding AR
* In this section, we'll acquaint ourselves with some of the current thoughts about AR.

## Insights from [Augmenting Your Reality (TechStuff Podcast)](http://shows.howstuffworks.com/techstuff/augmenting-your-reality.htm)
* Augmented reality is using digital information to enhance an experience in our physical world.
* Examples include a camera's view finder, a head mounted display like the HoloLens, etc.
* VR is different, in that a computer is making all the things you see, hear or even touch.
* Rule of Thumb: *Transparent Headset? AR! Opaque Headset? VR!*
* Mixed Reality is a blend, e.g. physical objects in the room being mapped to virtual ones.
* Ideas about AR have existed since Sutherland ('65), but a couple of technological breakthroughs needed to happen:
	* Powerful mobile devices to alleviate the need for tethered headsets.
	* GPS being accurate from 100m to a few feet.
	* Gyroscopes and accelerometers to help devices understand their orientation.
* Example of dumb AR:
	* Objective: Phone app that animates a movie poster
	* Place say 8 predetermined points on poster. 
	* App identifies these to activate and place the AR experience appropriately.
* Example of smart AR:
	* Objective: Identify a building (in an area with poor signage). 
	* App taps into GPS, accelerometer and image recognition to display the building label on the screen.
	* Google Glass wasn't smart, but it tapped into the phone, which tapped into the larger web.
* Krueger's Video Place (1974):
	* Objective: Create an AR experience that didn't require head-mounted displays nor special gloves.
	* Dancers' silhouettes would interact with the ball, but the ball was only virtual.
	* This piece raises the question of how to develop AR that doesn't deduct from the real world experience.
* Other pioneers of AR ideas:
	* Cabell, Boeing: AR to enable even newbies to lay the cables in an airplane.
	* Rosenberg, Air Force: System that could allow someone to control devices remotely.
	* Loral Western: AR that could create virtual opponents for war pilots' simulations.
	* Military '99: Soldiers felt it created unnecessary distractions.
* Promises of AR:
	* Debug sth, say electrical outlet, while leveraging the expertise of the designers.
	* Pok√©mon GO, though rudimentary AR, showed that masses can adopt AR.
	* Location-based apps, e.g. museum app that provides more info about the artifacts.
	* Dystopian ads? Imagine personalized ads popping up when casually looking at an ad.

## [The 1st Decade of AR by Ben Evans, Andreessen Horowitz](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/4/10/the-first-decade-of-augmented-reality)
* Google Glass was basically a smart watch, oblivious of your surrounding.
* True AR would 3D map your surrounding, allowing stuff like pulling up Minecraft on a table.
* Beyond [simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping), AR would need to understand the surrounding.
* For example, can AR identify a person and have Salesforce identify him/her as a key target customer?
* Controlling AR: Hand-tracking? Voice commands? Iris-tracking?
* Who selects the information that pops up? Do I see your LinkedIn, or your Tinder? Who controls the AI?
* Security concerns: If your AR is hacked, you'll hallucinate.
* Universality? Will AR headsets be as globally ubiquitous as the smartphone is poised to be.
