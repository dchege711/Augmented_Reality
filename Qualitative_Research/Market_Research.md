### Sample AR Use Cases

* Video Games:
	* Possibly the first consumer market to develop since gamers are usually early-adopters.
* Retail:
	* Volvo is using the HoloLens to configure Volvos in dealerships
	* Trying clothes without actually wearing them.
* Real Estate:
	* Designing home spaces when buying a house.
* HealthCare:
	* Projecting CT scans and MRIs to field of vision; scanning bar codes to get medical info.
	* Increasing precision, e.g. where to drill a hole into the skull.
	* Virtual instructions for novice patients. (*Side Note: Are we assuming that gaining mastery isn't necessary, or are there vast improvements to be made by doing this?*)
* Automotive:
	* Head-up Displays (HUDs), e.g. directions and safety measures, navigating poorly lit places.   
* Manufacturing and Repair:
    * AR could move manuals from text to superimposed holograms.
    * Boeing looking into AR to guide technicians in wiring. They currently use layout boards that are stored in several warehouses. (*Side Note: Did Boeing succeed?*)
* Annotation and Visualization:
    * It's about displaying information Just-In-Time, e.g. contents of library shelves.
    * Visualizations, e.g. proposed building, seeing objects in the night sky.
