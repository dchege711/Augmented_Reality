# AR In the News...
* [22nd Sept, 2017: Ford is now designing cars in MR using Microsoft HoloLens](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/ford-is-now-designing-cars-in-mixed-reality-using-microsoft-hololens/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29)
  * It's a test program, but Ford has reduced the time needed for making and reviewing changes from a few weeks to days.
* [21st Sept, 2017: Super Accurate GPS Chips Coming to Smartphones in 2018](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/design/superaccurate-gps-chips-coming-to-smartphones-in-2018)
  * Registration of the device is one of the hard problems in AR. Broadcomm's chips are poised to be accurate to 30cm as opposed to 5m.
* [11th Sept, 2017: Why AR is About to Take Over Your World](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/why-augmented-reality-is-about-take-over-your-world?utm_term=.jy0ePAlxNz#.tbjv38zLZB)
  * AR for the masses is still at the farting apps stage. We're still to see an Uber, but let's wait and see.
* [30th Aug, 2017: A Preview of iOS 11 AR Apps](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/a-preview-of-the-first-wave-of-ar-apps-coming-to-iphones/)
  * Pretty cool demos, featuring [IKEA](https://youtu.be/qQZIzbuymrw), [Food Network](https://youtu.be/diwT51QDEpY), [GIPHY World](https://youtu.be/0adc0oCKKKI), [Arise](https://youtu.be/mK2dJAsCjGI), [The Very Hungry Caterpillar](https://youtu.be/TJ3yL_7asmA) and [The Walking Dead](https://youtu.be/ImC8BPP_xBA). These apps make Pok√©mon Go look primitive.
* [29th Aug, 2017: ARCore for Android](https://developers.google.com/ar/)
  * Basically ARKit for Android. Major advantage: it supports Android Studio, Unity and Unreal.
* [29th Aug, 2017: 8th Wall release XR for smartphones](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/8th-wall-wants-to-put-awesome-ar-experiences-on-more-smartphones/)
  * XR is available as a free plug-in for Unity. It integrates with Apple's ARKit and Google's Tango. It will also enable (albeit limited) 3DoF AR functionality for general smartphones.
* [28th Aug, 2017: Windows Mixed Reality Update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/08/28/windows-mixed-reality-holiday-update/)
  * The Windows Mixed Reality team makes some bets on VR, offering built-in sensors, $399 headset + controller bundles and $499 mixed reality PCs. The HoloLens is conspicuously absent!
* [23rd Aug, 2017: AR's Future Isn't Glasses. It's the Car](https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/23/ar-will-drive-the-evolution-of-automated-cars/)
  * Once we have fully autonomous cars, AR can illustrate the AI's decisions, beam 'relevant' ads (urgh), and offer opportunities for gamification and social networks.
* [4th Aug, 2017: Omega Ophthalmics's Lens Implant Platform](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/04/ophthalmics-is-an-eye-implant-with-the-power-of-continuous-ar/)
   * They're creating a space in the eye for whoever wants to insert an [AR] implant. Still awaiting FDA approval. While this may face low uptake, lenses seem to be the most natural medium for AR. Phones, on the other hand, are the worst.
* [2nd Aug, 2017: Asus' ZenFone AR - The 2nd Phone to Use Tango](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/2/16087732/asus-zenfone-ar-google-tango-daydream-verizon-preorder-pricing)
    * Basically a normal smartphone with a mix of cameras and sensors. Verizon is selling one at $648
* [26th July, 2017: Disney's Magic Bench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnLk2_Xbr90)
    * YouTube video that shows the AR experiences made possible by designating a spot and not requiring the user to use a mediating device. Pretty cool if you ask me!
* [23rd July, 2017: Microsoft's Plan to Bring AI to the HoloLens](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-24/quest-for-ai-leadership-pushes-microsoft-further-into-chip-development)
   * Basically HPU v2.0. The current HoloLens recognizes phrases and understands the environment. Let's wait and see what AI will add to current capabilities (or maybe Bloomberg just threw around AI for clickbait).
* [18th July, 2017: The 4 Waves of Augmented Reality (that Apple owns)](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/the-four-waves-of-augmented-reality-that-apple-owns/).
   * Mobile AR Software, *e.g. ARKit, & Camera Effects*. Mobile AR Hardware, *e.g. Google Tango phones*. Tethered Smartglasses, *e.g. Meta*. Standalone Smartglasses, *e.g. Microsoft HoloLens*.
   * AR's 5 Consumer Challenges: hero device, all-day battery, mobile connectivity, app eco-system, telco cross-subsidization
* [18th July, 2017: A New Chapter for Glass](https://blog.x.company/a-new-chapter-for-glass-c7875d40bf24)
    * Google Glass isn't dead. They pivoted to industrial applications for the likes of General Electric and DHL. AR has been found suitable for industrial applications, but will it crack the consumer market?
