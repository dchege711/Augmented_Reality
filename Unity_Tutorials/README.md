## [Roll a Ball](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial/introduction-roll-ball?playlist=17141)
* The linked tutorial is an introduction to Unity's Engine.
* This code is totally independent of the HoloLens (but it can use the HoloLens as a screen).
* Most of the development was done inside Unity's GUI.

## [Mixed Reality Introduction (Holograms 100)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/holograms_100)
* This is the HelloWorld for the HoloLens. 
* The objective is to create a floating hologram of a cube in front of you.
* All of it was done within Unity's GUI; there are no C# scripts in this folder.
* Follow the project so as to have an idea of what goes where in a hologram.

## [Origami (Holograms 101)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/holograms_101)
* The linked tutorial is an introduction to holograms and the capabilities of a hololens.
* The tutorial is fast-paced with lots of copy-paste. Slow down and examine the code.
* It introduces concepts such as gaze, gestures, voice input, spatial sound and spatial mapping.
* I've included a README of the observations I made along the way. The C# scripts are heavily commeneted.

## Screenshots
* In some of the tutorials, I took pictures of what I was seeing.
* You don't need to open this folder; all relevant images have been presented at the appropriate context.
