## Introduction to Augmented Reality (AR)
* AR - overlays digital information in order to enhance a real physical experience, e.g. HoloLens, Google Glass, Pok√©mon Go.
* VR - a computer is making up all the things you see, hear and touch, e.g. Oculus Rift, HTC Vive.
* Click [here](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/blob/master/Qualitative_Research/Understanding_AR.md) for a more detailed introduction.
* [Market implications](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/blob/master/Qualitative_Research/Market_Research.md). Global revenues are projected to hit [$143 bn](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42331217) by 2020. AR & VR are in the early adopters phase, trying to get to mass adoption.

## The Microsoft HoloLens
* For my research queries, I'll be using the HoloLens as my AR device. [Here are its specs](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/blob/master/Qualitative_Research/HoloLens_Hardware_Specs.mdown)
* Think of the HoloLens as a smarter Google Glass that doesn't need your phone in order to be useful.

## Developing AR Content
* I'm using the [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com/); you may have seen it in Assassin's Creed or Temple Run.
* General procedure: Code the game in Unity (and some C#), port the HoloLens to my laptop & measure the desired variables. 
* I'll soon incorporate Vuforia to help me better utilize the HoloLens's mapping features and measure the associated data. 
* I'm using Windows 10 since there's more documentation on PC platforms. I'm maintaining a folder of the Unity projects in this [folder](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/tree/master/Unity).

## Enter Fog Computing
* One of the ways to alleviate the cost of adopting AR technologies is by treating the AR devices as edge devices.
* Last week and this week, I tried [quantifying](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/tree/master/Quantitative_Research) how much bandwidth would be required to run a HoloLens from the cloud.
* For [Origami](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/tree/master/Unity_Tutorials/Origami), an AR app that projected holograms, played background music and interpreted the 'select' hand gesture, [5.3 Mb of data was transferred per second](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality/blob/master/Quantitative_Research/README.md).
* Therefore, for an enterprise running a similar AR app from the cloud, we can anticipate an hourly usage of 2.4 GB on each device.

## Next Steps
* I plan on setting up more AR apps with different capabilities in order to get a sense of bandwidth requirements for different AR configurations.
* In addition to bandwidth, I aim to quantify the computational resources needed for different AR configurations. Combined with bandwidth data, we will explore the trade-offs involved.

## Keeping Tabs?
* I'm maintaining all the work here on [Github](https://github.com/dchege711/Augmented_Reality).

## Feedback
* Set up at least 10 min before demo. 
* Specify what kind of data is being transferred.
* Look into multiple cards for making multi-user connections.
