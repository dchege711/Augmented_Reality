# Overview of Augmented_Reality

* The Augmented_Reality repository will serve as an introduction to augmented reality technologies.
* This work is being done under [Princeton EDGE Lab](http://scenic.princeton.edu/about.php).
* We mainly used Microsoft's Hololens Development Edition for this project.

* Here is our roadmap:

### Understanding AR :white_check_mark:
* We'll aim to build a workable intuition of how AR works, and build a distinction between AR and VR.

### Market Research & Use Cases :white_check_mark:
* We'll consider the different AR devices in the market, and how they have fared.
* Aside from gaming, we'll look at other uses of AR technologies across different devices.

### Technology Research ...
* We'll analyze the nitty-gritty details, e.g. how an AR device maps its environment, communication protocols, computational ability (important to fog computing), etc.

### Multiuser Scenarios ...
* We'll explore how multiple AR devices can interact with each other in the augmented space.

### Limitations of AR
* We'll address limitations faced by AR technologies, e.g. graphics resolution, battery life, bulkiness, etc.
